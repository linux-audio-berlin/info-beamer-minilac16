Room visualization used at 30c3.

This is almost the code that ran at 30c3. I had to remove the font used 
as the font used at 30c3 cannot be redistributed. The replacement font
is "Roboto light". See http://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/roboto

Installation:
    
    Nothing to do

Usage:
    
    start info-beamer for this directory.
    Then run ./service
